## The Repo Structure
The project has 2 branches: `main` and `initial-project-state`. 
* The initial project state is located in the `initial-project-state` branch.
* The final project version is located in the `main` branch

Each course lesson has a corresponding commit in `main` branch in the format `lesson(CourseSection) Topic name`, so if you need to grab a lesson code you can go to [the commit history](https://github.com/DecodedFrontend/advanced-angular-forms/commits/main)

If you just need the initial state of the course project, then just clone the `initial-project-state` branch.

## Project Description
The project is a simple Angular workspace generated by Angular CLI. It consists of 2 projects:
* `forms-playground` - Regular Angular application that contains playgrounds for different topics: Template-Driven forms, Reactive Forms, etc;
* `custom-form-controls` - Angular library where will be created custom components like Select and Rating picker.

## How to start
This project has been created using Angular CLI, so you can start the project as any other Angular project. 

If you start the project from the `initial-project-state` branch, then just run 
* `npm install`
* `npm run start` - starts the *forms-playground* project;

If you start the final application from the `main` branch:
* `npm install`
* `npm run build --project custom-form-controls -- --watch` - builds the library with custom components (if you don't want to run it in watch-mode then run without `-- --watch`)
* `npm run start` - starts the *forms-playground* project;
